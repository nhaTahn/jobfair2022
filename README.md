# NH2 v1.0.0

## Introduction
This Web App was named as NH2. It is used to support student attendance and lucky draw in CSE JobFair of HCMUT in 2021 (in 2022, April 3rd).

## Technical stacks
NodeJS (with framework ExpressJS) for backend.\
ReactJS (with supported library MUI for components creating and redux for global state storing) for frontend.\
HTTP-based-RPC and Web Socket are two protocols used to communicate between front end and back end. While HTTP-based-RPC is used to communicate in lucky draw action, Web Socket is used to support for student attendance.

## Installation
Install ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS and npm (node package management) for installing dependencies and running this app.\
For installing dependencies for frontend and backend, go to each folder and read the README.md.\

## Running
Start frontend at port 3000 and backend at port 8000 of the localhost.\
Set localStorage in browser following the README.md in client folder for ensuring that the web app will be active.\

## Status
All deployment of NH2v1.0 has been deprecated because of Heroku limit the number of hours deploying each web app.
